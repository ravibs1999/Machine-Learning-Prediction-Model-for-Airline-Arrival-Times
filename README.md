# Machine-Learning-Prediction-Model-for-Airline-Arrival-Times
# Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict airline arrival times at Syracuse (SYR) airport, focusing on identifying factors causing delays, including weather conditions. The model aimed to categorize flight arrival statuses as 'EARLY', 'ON-TIME', or 'DELAYED'.

# Responsibilities and Contributions:
Collected historical flight data (2019-2023) from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and historical weather data from Weatherbit API.
Performed data preprocessing, including feature selection, missing value handling, and feature engineering.
Merged weather and flight data for accurate prediction analysis.
Trained and evaluated machine learning models using StackingClassifier, Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier.
Achieved a prediction accuracy of 56% for the initial model.
Technologies:
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Weatherbit API, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data

# Achievements:
Built a comprehensive machine learning model predicting flight delays with 56% accuracy, contributing to potential improvements in airline scheduling and passenger satisfaction.
